# RapidFort hardened image for Apache Airflow Scheduler

RapidFort’s container optimization process hardened this Apache Airflow Scheduler container. This container is free to use and has no license limitations.

It is the same as the [Bitnami Apache Airflow Scheduler][source-image-repo-link] image but more secure.

Every day, we optimize and harden a variety of Docker Hub’s most famous images. Check out our [entire library](https://hub.docker.com/u/rapidfort) of secured containers.

## Vulnerabilities: Original vs. Hardened

[![CVE Reduction][cve-reduction-link]][rf-image-link]

## What is Apache Airflow Scheduler?

> Apache Airflow (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

## How do I use this hardened Apache Airflow Scheduler image?

The runtime instructions for this container are no different from the official release. Follow the instructions in their readme, but use our hardened image.

```sh
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# install airflow, just replace repository with RapidFort registry
$ helm install my-airflow bitnami/airflow --set image.repository=rapidfort/airflow

```

## What is a hardened image?

A hardened image is a copy of a container that has been optimized and reduced for significantly improved security. Because every container uses many open-source software components and their dependencies, there’s a lot of extra weight that can be trimmed.

This image is a hardened version of the official [Bitnami Apache Airflow Scheduler][source-image-repo-link] image on Docker Hub.

RapidFort is an industry-leading container optimization solution that minimizes software attack surfaces by removing unused code. Most containers can be reduced by at least 50%, which reduces the opportunity for malicious attacks and CVE exploits. Learn more at [RapidFort.com][rf-link].

Our hardened images are updated daily using the latest vulnerability information available.


## What’s the difference between the official [Bitnami Apache Airflow Scheduler][source-image-repo-link] image and this hardened image?
RapidFort’s hardened [rapidfort/airflow-scheduler][rf-dh-image-link] image has been optimized by our proprietary scanning and slimming technology. We are big fans of open-source software, containerized infrastructure, and security.

We are making secure copies of the images we use every day and the most popular ones on Docker Hub. We want to make the world a safer place to operate.
